**ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to your my Foam Knowledge Base!**


## Using Foam

We've created a few Bubbles (Markdown documents) to get you started.

- [[inbox]] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorized later
- [[getting-started]] - learn how to use your Foam workspace
- [[todo]] - a place to keep track of things to do

In the `docs` directory you can find everything you need to learn the basics of Foam.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[inbox]: inbox "Inbox"
[getting-started]: getting-started "Getting Started"
[todo]: todo "Todo"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
